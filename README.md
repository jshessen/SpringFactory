# SpringFactory

This was just a mock-up to replicate the original design from   regarding his 

I noticed [this pop-up on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2022/01/28/3d-printed-jig-makes-custom-springs-a-snap/) and thought I would take some time to model this out in OpenSCAD.

This is a remix of [Spring Factory 1.2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5171637) by [Vincent Baillet](https://www.thingiverse.com/vbaillet). My focus was modeling a near mirror of the original design extending so that all (I think) values can be overwritten to enable custom dimensions.

I have included STL for each of the components, as rendered from OpenSCAD, as well as the design file, and a 3MF file which includes vbaillet original print recommendations.

All of the code/files are contained within GitHub - SpringFactory
